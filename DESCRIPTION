Description: The easysurv package aims to simplify fitting parametric
    models for extrapolating survival data. It facilitates plotting
    Kaplan-Meier curves, assessing the proportional hazards assumption,
    estimating and predicting from parametric survival models using engines 
    such as flexsurv, flexsurvspline, flexsurvcure, and survival, and exporting 
    the outputs to Excel.
