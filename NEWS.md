# easysurv 1.1.0

-   `plot_fits()` now uses flexsurv to generate survival predictions in plots, which matches the prediction method in `predict_fits()`. The original prediction method (via survHE) can be used instead by setting the new argument `plot_predictions = "survHE"` for `plot_fits()` and any functions that use `plot_fits()` (e.g., `quick_fit_select()`, `quick_fit()`).
-   `predict_fits()` now outputs a list object that includes 95% confidence intervals for the predicted survival probabilities. CIs can be excluded by setting `include_ci = FALSE`. The `include_ci` argument is available for all functions that use `predict_fits()` or objects generated by `predict_fits()` (e.g., `quick_fit_select()`, `quick_fit()`).
-   A dependency on the `cli` package has been added to support aesthetic and informative warning messages, such as in the `quick_to_XL()` function.
